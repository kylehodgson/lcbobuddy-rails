		 "price": "14.95",
		 "rating": "89",
		 "description": "Syrah is my favorite red variety from South Africa, especially when the fruit comes from the non-irrigated, old-vine Swartland region, which is emerging as a prime area for Rhone-style wines. <em>The taste</em>: This crowd-pleaser has strong smoky and oaky flavours, with pure violets, pepper and black cherry. It is medium-full bodied, fresh, juicy and supple with some tannin. The length is excellent. <em>How to drink it</em>: A wine for grilled and smoked meats. Chill ever so slightly.",

		 "category": "Red",
		 "region": "New Zealand",
		 "price": "15.95",
		 "rating": "91",
		 "description": "One the great buys at the LCBO seems to get better every year, striking a calmer, more refined approach to New Zealand’s signature grape. <em>The taste</em>: The 2011 has a piquant, lifted nose of nettles, celery, dill, orange-grapefruit citrus and passion fruit—like a tropical fruit and citrus salad. It’s generous, intense and fresh, with just the right sweet-and-sour balance, a touch of CO2 liveliness and a very long herbal, citrus and mineral finish. <em>How to drink it</em>: Chill well for casual sipping. Pairs nicely with Asian cuisine.",

		 "rating": "87",
		 "description": "Argentina’s climate is great for syrah (also known as shiraz), but winemakers are almost blasé about it, in part because Australia has cornered the syrah market. This one has great structure and depth for $12. It’s a bit chunky and tannic, with ripe black cherry, licorice and meaty complexity.",

		 "description": "Originally from the Alps, the bon­arda grape is responsible for much of Argentina’s bulk wine, but it’s being upgraded through lower yields. This is a classic with deep purple colour and lifted floral, peppery and blueberry scents. It’s rounded, lively and juicy, with less tannin than malbec.",
